These are Python scripts written for the CS1101 introductory programming course at the
University of the People (UoPeople).

The scripts are simple and the comments included are self-explanatory.
You might notice that some files skip numbers. That is because there were no assignments
of that particular type during the week.

UoPeople is an American University that specializes in online classes.
